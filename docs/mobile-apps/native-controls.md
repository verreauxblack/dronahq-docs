## Caching

When you are binding remote data to a control, you have an option to Cache that data at control level. To enable caching, `Select Control -> Property -> Under Generic, Enable Caching`. This toggle will ensure that when remote data is fetched to a control, it will get cached in local device's `KV Storage` which leverages Native Mobile device's capability. It is important that at least once, the data should be return when online. So, when device is offline next time, the control will load data from previously stored local data thereby improving performance of the app.
