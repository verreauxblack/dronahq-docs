# Audit Logging

## Introduction

Audit Logs is a powerful feature within the DronaHQ platform that allows you to seamlessly integrate various loggers to capture events and activities from your modules, such as RunAPI. This feature enhances your ability to monitor, analyze, and manage logs efficiently. This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to enable and configure Audit Logging in your DronaHQ account.

DronaHQ Support following 2 types of Audit Logging -
1. [DronaHQ Managed Audit Logging](#dronahq-managed-audit-logging) (Available only on Self-hosted version)
1. [External Audit Logging](#external-audit-logging)

## DronaHQ Managed Audit Logging
DronaHQ managed audit logging enables you to capture events and activities from your modules without any external logger setup. This can be an alternative to any external logger that one may want to set up.
:::info
DronaHQ Managed Audit Logging is supported only on self hosted version.
:::

To enable this feature you need to configure this environment variable on your self-hosted environment file

    DHQ_MANAGED_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=’true’

Once this is enabled, your audit logs will be saved in the `dhq_managed_audit_log` collection which will be auto-created in your configured `DHQ_MONGODB_HOST` server with database name `DHQ_MONGODB_DATABASE`.
The above variables are configured while setting up self-hosted instance.

 Once this is set up, go to `Account Settings -> General & Security -> Audit Logging` section, you will find `DronaHQ managed Audit Logging is Enabled` message and to View Audit logs you can click on `View Audit Logs` button

Easily access and manage your audit logs with advanced filtering options, including date ranges, specific events, connectors, apps, and automation filters, and search by user email. Navigate seamlessly with pagination, ensuring efficient tracking and oversight of your logs

**Provide Connection Details**: Proceed to provide the necessary connection details for the selected logger. These details may include hostnames, ports, credentials, or any other information required to establish a connection.

**Create Integration**: Once you have entered the correct connection details, click on the "Create Integration" button. This action will initiate the integration process.

**Logger Initialization**: After successfully configuring the logger, you will receive a "Logger Initialized" message. This message indicates that the integration with the selected logger has been successfully established.

DronaHQ provides a feature that allows you to test custom logs, ensuring that the integration is functioning as expected. Here's how you can test custom logs:

**Access Custom Log Testing**: Within the Audit Logging settings, look for the "Test" button and Input will be displayed and one can enter the custom log and click on "Log" Button

**Logging Custom Details**: In this section, you can log specific details, such as event names, the user who is logged in, organization ID, and more. This information will be useful for monitoring and analyzing your system's activities.

By following these simple steps, you can seamlessly enable, configure, and test the Audit Logging feature in your DronaHQ account. This powerful tool allows you to efficiently manage and monitor event logs within your modules, enhancing your overall experience with the platform.

*Note: Ensure that you provide accurate connection details for the Audit logger to ensure smooth integration.*

## Purging older audit logs data to free up storage
If your self-hosted MongoDB database's "dhq_managed_audit_log collection" starts accumulating too much data, it's a good practice to ease the storage burden by taking backups and removing older audit logs, generally those older than 2-3 months.
