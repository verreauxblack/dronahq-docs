The Tabbed Container allows developers to organize and display content in a structured, tabbed interface, enhancing user experience by keeping the app's layout clean and intuitive. 

A Tabbed Container is a UI component designed to segregate content into multiple tabs. Each tab acts as a unique section, providing users with the ability to switch between content or functionalities seamlessly.

It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:
- Display grouped information under different categories.
- Build dashboards with different data views.
- Organize forms or settings into sections for better navigation.
- Create multi-step workflows with clear separation between steps.

## Content

:::info

In the Tabbed Container, If the tab value is altered, then the associated controls will be automatically removed. This is because the system maps controls based on the value key, not the label.  

It is best to:
- First set the tab value and then inject the controls accordingly to ensure they persist.
- Modify the tab label as it is safe and will not affect the controls.
