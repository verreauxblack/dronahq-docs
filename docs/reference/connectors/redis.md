Redis is used as a distributed, in-memory key-value database. Redis uses abstract data structures, such as strings,
lists, maps, etc. It is best suited for developers who need quick responses.

## Prerequisites

1. Authentication Credentials: Before establishing a connection with your Redis instance, ensure you have the required
   authentication credentials, which typically include:

   - Redis server hostname or IP address.
   - Port number for Redis communication.
   - Authentication password.

2. Connection Security:

   - Configure secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) if required by your Redis setup.

3. Firewall and Network Configuration:
   - Adjust your firewall settings to allow communication between your application and the Redis server.

Having these essential prerequisites in place will ensure a secure and seamless integration of Redis with your
applications, facilitating efficient data management and utilization.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details. Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save`
settings for secure database setup.

:::tip 
DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's
[connection string](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Configuration).

## Adding Data Queries

1. Query Name: Assign a unique name to your data retrieval query. This name will help you easily identify and access the
   query within your Connector Library.

2. Select Action - Get Value by Key: Choose the `Get Value by Key` action from the available options in the Redis
   connector. This action allows you to retrieve the value associated with a specific key in the Redis key-value store.

3. Configure Parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key        | Specify the key for which you want to retrieve the value.           |
| Field      | Specify the field name within a Redis hash to retrieve the value.   |
| Index Name | Specify the name of the index for querying Redis Sorted Sets.       |
| Member     | Specify the member within a Redis Sorted Set to retrieve the value. |

4. Execute the Query: After configuring the parameters, execute the query by clicking the `Run` button. The value
   associated with the specified key will be fetched from the Redis database.

Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to
controls/actions and more for runtime use.

## Using Redis Connector for Data Retrieval

### Get All Keys

To retrieve all keys from your Redis database using the Redis connector, follow these steps:

1. Choose the `Keys` Action: Begin by selecting the action type as `Keys` within the Redis connector options. This will
   allow you to interact with the keys stored in your Redis database.

2. Configure the Action for All Keys: In order to retrieve all keys, set the key pattern as `*` (an asterisk), which
   serves as a special character to match all keys in your Redis database.

      <figcaption align = "center"><i>Redis Keys Action to get all keys.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. Data Display Configuration: Configure the query to display the retrieved keys in a control, such as a dropdown. To do
   this, navigate to Bind Data > Connectors and set up the query accordingly.

4. Test and Implement: After providing the necessary parameters and configuring the query, perform a test run to ensure
   the query functions as intended. Once validated, finalize the configuration and implement the connector.

5. Access Data for Dropdown Control: To fetch the retrieved keys for the dropdown control, use the `result.rows`
   parameter to access the data returned by the query.
