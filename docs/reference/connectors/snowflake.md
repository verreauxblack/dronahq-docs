Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that offers fast and flexible analytics. It enables seamless
handling of large-scale data while providing advanced data sharing and processing capabilities.

## Prerequisite

1. Authentication Requirements: To establish a connection with your Snowflake instance, you will require specific
   authentication credentials. You have the choice of either of the following two credential options:

   - Snowflake database username and password.
   - Alternative authentication methods (excluding AWS IAM authentication).

2. Connection Details:

   - Hostname of the Snowflake database.
   - Port number for database communication.
   - The designated database name within the Snowflake host.

3. Firewall Rules:
   - Set up your firewall settings to permit DronaHQ's IP whitelist for access to your Snowflake host.

Having these essential prerequisites in place will ensure a seamless integration of Snowflake with DronaHQ, facilitating
efficient data management and utilization.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details. Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save`
settings for secure database setup.

:::tip 
DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's
[connection string](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/odbc/odbc-parameters#connection-parameters).

### Whitelisting DronaHQ

To begin the process, you must first whitelist DronaHQ. Follow these steps meticulously:

1. Set Admin Privileges for User Role: Initiate the procedure by granting yourself administrative privileges by assuming
   the role of "securityadmin." Employ the following command within the worksheets:

   ```sql
   USE ROLE securityadmin;
   ```

2. Create Network Policy and Whitelist IPs: Proceed to create a network policy to facilitate whitelisting of IPs.
   Implement the ensuing command to achieve this:

   ```sql
   CREATE NETWORK POLICY DHQ_WHITELIST ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('Your IP', 'DronaHQ IP', ...);
   ```

3. Apply Network Policy: Execute the subsequent command to apply the newly created network policy:

   ```sql
   ALTER ACCOUNT SET NETWORK_POLICY = DHQ_WHITELIST;
   ```

4. Verify Policy Configuration: Confirm the network policy configuration and details by querying it using the following
   command:

   ```sql
   DESC NETWORK POLICY DHQ_WHITELIST;
   ```

5. Account Name Retrieval: To ensure accurate account whitelisting, extract the account name from your Snowflake
   database URL. Access the URL at `https://<account-name>.snowflakecomputing.com`.

   - For instance, if your URL is `https://dronahq-test-account.snowflakecomputing.com`, the account name would be
     `dronahq-test-account`.
   - In AWS scenarios, URLs might resemble `https://dronahq-test-account.us-east-2.aws.snowflakecomputing.com`, where
     the account name is `dronahq-test-account.us-east-2.aws`.
   - In the case of Azure, URLs could appear as `https://dronahq-test-account.west-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com`,
     and the corresponding account name would be `dronahq-test-account.west-us-2.azure`.

## Adding Database Queries

After configuring the connector, access it in your Connector Library.

Click `Add query` once the connection is established. Create queries, run them, and view responses.

:::tip 
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to
controls/actions for runtime use.

## Using Snowflake Connector

### Data Bind using Data Query

#### Read/Display Data Query for Snowflake:

Begin by crafting an SQL query to extract data from your Snowflake database. For example, let's consider a scenario
where you want to retrieve data from the `TRIPS` table with ordering, limiting, and offset. The SQL query is:

Query used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TRIPS ORDER BY BIKEID LIMIT {{limit}} OFFSET {{offset}};
```

Query explanation:

This SQL query retrieves all rows and columns from the `TRIPS` table and orders them by `BIKEID`. The results are
limited based on the `{{limit}}` value and offset by the `{{offset}}` value, which are dynamic variables.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Query example with dynamic variables for pagination.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Integrate the fetched data into your application's interface.

a. Access the Controls section and introduce the Table grid control.

b. Navigate to `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Database Queries`.

c. Opt for the Snowflake connector and choose the query that aligns with your data presentation goals.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly retrieve and display data from the `TRIPS` table using the Snowflake
Connector, enhancing your application's functionality and user experience with ordering, limiting, and offset features.
